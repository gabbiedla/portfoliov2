          the pleasure of working with. She is able to take a project from start
          to finish by scoping out all potential roadblocks and create a
          projected plan for resolution. Not only this, but she is constantly
          looking for ways to improve team processes for efficiency sake. She is
          highly motivated and a true delight so that anyone would be lucky to
          work with her."

          When we were on the Marketplace team together, I was always able to
          rely on her as a knowledgeable resource, as well as someone who can
          connect the dots and provide insights as to how certain actions affect
          the business.”

          say enough great things about her. She was able to learn fast, be
          efficient, and produce top numbers with little hand holding. She was
          responsible for building out new processes for various products, and
          guiding people though complicated funnel steps. I have a lot of
          respect for her work ethic and drive, and look forward to hopefully
          working with her again soon.”
